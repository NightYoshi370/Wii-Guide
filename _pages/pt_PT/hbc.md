The Homebrew Channel is where you will go to launch homebrew applications. BootMii is a piece of software that can backup and restore your Wii's NAND storage, and if installed in boot2, provides brick protection.

#### Instruções

1. Irás ver um ecrã de aviso de scam. Espera 30 segundos para o texto "Press 1 to continue" aparecer, depois pressiona 1. ![Scam Screen](/images/Wii/ScamScreen.png)

5. Once installed, press back and go to BootMii.
6. If the main screen says you can install as boot2, do so. This gives you a level of brick protection that loads as part of the Wii's boot process, and lets you load homebrew to fix the brick or restore from a NAND backup.
7. If it does not say you can install as boot2, install as IOS. While this doesn't give you brick protection compared to its boot2 counterpart, it will still allow you to make a NAND backup.

8. Once done, select `Continue` to exit the HackMii installer.
